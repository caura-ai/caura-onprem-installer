"""The CI gate for hard rule 7 of the sunset plan: mint nothing new with the old brand.

The script lives at ``scripts/legacy_name_ratchet.py`` and compares the legacy-name
line count per file between the tree being built and a base tree, failing on any
file that went up.

These tests build a throwaway git repository per case and run the real script
against it. Mocking ``git grep`` would test the arithmetic and none of the part
that actually breaks — the output parsing, the tree-ish prefix, and the
case-insensitive match are all git's behaviour, not ours.

# gate cannot tell them apart and no build changes colour because of which one is
# used; only the report reads the difference. It exists because the two
# populations grow from different work — an alias arrives when something is

# is EDITED — so under one marker the mentions bury the aliases. Measured on
# caura-daemon#136: eleven exemptions in one PR, four of them aliases.


# One regex serves both markers, with the boundaries outside the alternation, so
# there is no second code path for a per-marker copy of these to cover — a
# loosened bound loosens both at once. These are parametrized rather than cloned
# so that is what gets asserted, and so a third marker is one list entry.
#
# The ``legacy-name-ok`` cases above are deliberately left standing and unedited.
# They pin that marker's own contract independently of this table, which is worth
# keeping on a gate where the whole promise is that nothing about the existing
