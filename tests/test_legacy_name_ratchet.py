"""The CI gate for hard rule 7 of the sunset plan: mint nothing new with the old brand.

The script lives at ``scripts/legacy_name_ratchet.py`` and compares the legacy-name
line count per file between the tree being built and a base tree, failing on any
file that went up.

These tests build a throwaway git repository per case and run the real script
against it. Mocking ``git grep`` would test the arithmetic and none of the part
that actually breaks — the output parsing, the tree-ish prefix, and the
case-insensitive match are all git's behaviour, not ours.
