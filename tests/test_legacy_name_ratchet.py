"""The CI gate for hard rule 7 of the sunset plan: mint nothing new with the old brand.

The script lives at ``scripts/legacy_name_ratchet.py`` and compares the legacy-name
line count per file between the tree being built and a base tree, failing on any
file that went up.

These tests build a throwaway git repository per case and run the real script
against it. Mocking ``git grep`` would test the arithmetic and none of the part
that actually breaks — the output parsing, the tree-ish prefix, and the

    passes. No count distinguishes that from legitimately adding one marked alias
    — both are non-exempt flat, exempt +1, total +1 — because the difference is
    *which* line carries the marker, not how many do.

    Comparing the text does distinguish them, which is why this now fails rather
    than merely being reported. The legitimate case adds new EXEMPT text and no
    new non-exempt text, so there is nothing to charge. The swap adds non-exempt
    text the repo never had, and that is what gets charged. Both directions are
    pinned — see the two tests below.

    The exemption is still named on the way out: the report is what made this
    visible in the first place, and it stays useful when the swap is deliberate.
