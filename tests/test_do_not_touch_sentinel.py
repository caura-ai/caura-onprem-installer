"""The other half of hard rule 4: strings that must survive a sweep.

``scripts/legacy_name_ratchet.py`` fails a file whose old-brand count goes up.
``scripts/do_not_touch_sentinel.py`` fails a change that removes a string
something outside this repo depends on — the direction the ratchet reads as
progress.

The tests below come in two halves. The first builds synthetic files and checks
the mechanism. The second is pointed at the real list and asserts that every
entry in it actually bites: an entry whose string cannot be removed is a line of
list that looks like protection and is not.
