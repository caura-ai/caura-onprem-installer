"""The other half of hard rule 4: strings that must survive a sweep.

``scripts/legacy_name_ratchet.py`` fails a file whose old-brand count goes up.
``scripts/do_not_touch_sentinel.py`` fails a change that removes a string
something outside this repo depends on — the direction the ratchet reads as
progress.

The tests below come in two halves. The first builds synthetic files and checks
the mechanism, which is copied byte-for-byte from caura-ai/caura along with the
script; keeping these cases identical is what makes the two copies diffable. The
second is pointed at this repo's own list and asserts that every entry in it
actually bites: an entry whose string cannot be removed is a line of list that
looks like protection and is not.
