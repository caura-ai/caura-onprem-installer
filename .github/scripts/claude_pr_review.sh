# Shared Claude PR review.
#
# Fetches a pull request's diff from the GitHub API, reviews it with Claude, and
# posts the result as a PR comment. BOTH the on-open `claude-review` job and the
# `@claude` `claude-retrigger` job call this same script, so the two paths are
# guaranteed identical — historically they diverged, and the on-open path (the
# claude-code-action agent) never actually received the diff: it tried to fetch
# it via `gh`, hit the headless permission wall, and the workflow then stamped a
# meaningless "No issues found". Feeding the diff on stdin to `claude --print`
# is the mechanism that demonstrably works.
#
# Required env:
#   REPO              owner/name
#   PR_NUMBER         pull request number
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Anthropic API key
#   GH_TOKEN          token with pull-requests:write / issues:write
#   EXTRA_PROMPT      repo context, prepended to the review prompt
#   REVIEW_PROMPT     review instructions + output format
# Optional env:
#   MODEL             model id (default: claude-sonnet-5)
#   MAX_BUDGET_USD    per-review spend ceiling, passed to --max-budget-usd (default 10.00)

# A ceiling so one runaway review cannot bill without bound. The reviewer reads the repo
# across turns to judge a diff, which is what makes it useful and also what makes an
# unbounded run possible; sibling repos on the org's shared pipeline have billed $6.11 on a
# two-file diff. The org-membership gate above stops a fork pull request from triggering a
# review at all, but it does not bound what a member's large pull request costs.
#
# A runaway guard, not a budget target. The CLI checks the ceiling BETWEEN turns, so a run
# can overshoot it by roughly one turn, and on a single hung turn it never fires at all —
# the job timeout is the only bound there. Sized above observed spend on purpose: the
# expensive reviews are the ones that find real defects, so capping near the average would
# truncate exactly the runs worth paying for.
MAX_BUDGET_USD="${MAX_BUDGET_USD:-10.00}"
# Shape, then value. Shape does not require a leading digit, so `.50` is accepted the way the
# CLI accepts it, while `.`, `1.`, `10,00`, `$10`, `-1` and `1e3` are rejected. Value is
# checked arithmetically rather than with a second pattern: a zero ceiling is accepted by the
# CLI and makes every review fail on its first turn — which reads as a broken pipeline rather
# than a bad setting — and spelling "zero" as a regex means enumerating 0, 00, 0.0, .0, 0.00
# and .00, where the no-leading-digit forms are the easy ones to miss.

# No learned-guidance recall here, unlike the copy in caura-ai/caura.

# That feature reads an org secret whose visibility is `private`, and this repo is PUBLIC, so
# it can never resolve — the OSS copy says as much in its own comment. Carrying it would be
# permanently dead code, and it would also drag an old-brand secret name into a repo the
# legacy-name ratchet gates, failing the very PR that adds this workflow. Dropped rather than
# exempted: an exemption marker here would have to claim a reason that is not true.

Review the PR diff provided on stdin. Review ONLY the changed lines. If after a careful review you find no real issues, reply with exactly this single line and nothing else:
**Claude Code Review** :white_check_mark: No issues found."

# No 2>&1: claude's stderr (warnings/progress) must not contaminate the JSON on
# stdout, or jq would parse garbage and yield an empty review. A non-zero exit is
# still caught below; stderr goes to the workflow log for debugging.
# --tools is the security half, and it matters more here than anywhere: this repo is PUBLIC.
# The threat is concrete — a prompt injection in the diff reaching a CLI whose environment holds
# GH_TOKEN with pull-requests:write. Restricting the reviewer to read-only tools leaves the
# injection nothing to act through. Reviewing a diff needs Read, Grep and Glob and nothing else.
#
# --bare closes two paths the allow-list provably does not reach, so it is load-bearing rather
# than belt-and-braces. --tools names tools from the BUILT-IN set, so it does nothing about
# MCP-provided ones: a pull request adding an .mcp.json would otherwise hand the reviewer tools
# outside the allow-list entirely. --bare also skips CLAUDE.md auto-discovery, so a reviewed
# tree's own CLAUDE.md cannot quietly steer the review of that same tree.
#
# Both flags exist in the pinned 2.1.159 installed above. Verify them again when bumping the pin
# — a build that dropped either would review in a writable mode without saying so.

# WHICH REVIEWER WROTE THIS, said before the review rather than only after it. Mirrors the shared
# pipeline (caura-ai/.github#34, released in v1.5.1) so a verdict reads the same wherever it was
# posted — which is the point of mirroring it at all: someone comparing a review here against one
# on a repo that runs the shared pipeline should not have to work out that the formats differ.
#
# A blockquote, not a heading: a verdict opens with its own `## Summary` or `### Issue Title`, and
# a second heading above those would compete with the review's structure instead of labelling it.
#
# Hardcoded rather than read from an AGENT_LABEL variable, unlike upstream. This copy runs ONE
# reviewer and is deliberately standalone, so a variable with a single possible value would be
# indirection without a second caller — the same reasoning that inlined recall here.
#
# Deliberately NOT the string "Reviewed by \`" — claude_pr_capture.sh greps exactly that to decide
# whether a pull request was reviewed at all, and the footer below is what it is meant to find. A
# header carrying the same phrase would still match, but it would make that gate depend on which
# of the two lines survived thread truncation, and capture keeps the TAIL.
#
# Footer surfaces per-review spend on the PR itself, not just the job log.
